1. Build Bulk Structure
   1.1 lattice parameter of unit cell of bulk structure
2. Cut surface
   2.1 cut (110) surface from (100) surface, tool is VESTA.
       transformation matrix is (0 -1 1
                                 0  1 1
                                 1  0 0)
   2.2 be attention to the termination. do the test and literature review to check which termination is most stable.
   2.3 The top and bottom surface should be same.
